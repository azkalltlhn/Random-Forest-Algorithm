# Random Forest Algorithm

# Introduction
Random Forest is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It builds multiple decision trees and combines their results to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.

# Key Features
1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing data before training the model.
2. Model Training: Implementing Random Forest Classifier using scikit-learn.
3. Model Evaluation: Measuring performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.

# Installation and Usage
1. **Clone this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/azkalltlhn/Gradient_Boosting_Classifier.git

2. **Install the required dependencies::**
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn

3. Run the notebook:
- Open Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
- Load the file Random_Forest_Azka_Lailatul_Hana.ipynb
- Run all cells.

# Results and Evaluation
The model is evaluated using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix to assess its effectiveness.
